# ‚öñÔ∏è React vs Next.js ‚Äì Comparison Table

| Feature                       | **React (Library)**                         | **Next.js (Framework built on React)**                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**                      | UI library for building components          | Full-stack framework (frontend + backend features)                          |
| **Routing**                   | Needs external library (e.g., React Router) | Built-in **file-based routing** (`pages/` or `app/`)                        |
| **Rendering**                 | CSR by default (client-side rendering)      | Supports **SSR, SSG, ISR, CSR** (hybrid rendering)                          |
| **SEO Support**               | Limited (needs pre-rendering tools)         | Excellent SEO (pre-rendered HTML sent to client)                            |
| **Data Fetching**             | Custom fetch (e.g., `useEffect`)            | Built-in methods (`getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticPaths`) |
| **Backend Support**           | None (frontend-only)                        | Has **API Routes** (`pages/api`) for backend logic                          |
| **Performance Optimizations** | Manual setup (code splitting, lazy loading) | Automatic code splitting, prefetching, bundling                             |
| **Image Optimization**        | Requires third-party libs                   | Built-in `<Image>` component (lazy loading, resizing, WebP)                 |
| **Styling**                   | CSS-in-JS, styled-components, etc.          | Supports **CSS Modules, Sass, Tailwind, styled-components**                 |
| **TypeScript Support**        | Supported via config                        | Built-in first-class support                                                |
| **Middleware**                | Not available                               | Built-in Middleware (auth, redirects, edge logic)                           |
| **Deployment**                | Any static host (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)     | Best with **Vercel**, but works with AWS, Netlify, etc.                     |
| **Learning Curve**            | Easier for beginners (UI-focused)           | Slightly steeper (SSR, API routes, routing, configs)                        |
| **Best For**                  | SPAs, dashboards, internal tools            | SEO-heavy apps, blogs, e-commerce, production apps                          |

# üîë In short:

* **React** = Just the *UI building blocks*.
* **Next.js** = React + routing + rendering strategies + API backend + performance optimizations.
